   "LISTEN" : "During a conversation, it's important to show the other person that you are listening and paying attention. Knowing that you're listening makes them want to continue the conversation.",
   "TELL" : "When we continue to face difficulties, it is easy to get so caught up in the problems around us that we forget to pay attention to the good that others have done for us. Recognizing these positives will reinforce your sense of belonging and your ability to do well. Furthermore, when people realize they can do something good, they tend to do more good things to please others.",
   "FAVOR" : "We all come across situations in our lives when we need to ask someone to do something or change their behavior. If you seem annoyed or demanding, the other person is usually not motivated to do what you ask them to do. Asking for favors in a positive way is less stressful and more likely to be honored.",
   "REFUSE" : "When people ask you to do something, you may not always be able to do so. You may be very busy, feel incapable, or don't want to do what you're asked to do. If you're rude or abrupt when declining a request, you'll likely hurt someone's feelings or make them angry. On the other hand, if you don't say it outright or say it in a hesitant way, it can lead to misunderstandings and arguments."
