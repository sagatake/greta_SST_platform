                Thank you for waiting. Here is your result.
            <tm id="tm1"/>
                I think eye contact was good.

	    <tm id="tm2"/>
		If you can handle eye contact, you can express how you tries to answer the request.

	    <tm id="tm3"/>
		So that should be good communication!
            <tm id="tm4"/>
                It will be better communication when you pay a little bit more attention to voice variation.

	    <tm id="tm5"/>
		You can express how you are feeling, which makes the conversation confortable for you and the interlocutor.

	    <tm id="tm6"/>
		If you think the improving voice variation seems diffcult, I advise you to slightly lower the tone of voice
