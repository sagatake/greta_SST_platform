                Thank you for waiting. Here is your result.
            <tm id="tm1"/>
                I think eye-contact was good. If you can handle eye-contact, you can tell how strongly you want to ask them to do it  . So that should be good communication!
            <tm id="tm2"/>
                It will be better communication when you pay a little bit more attention to facial-expression.You can tell how you are feeling specifically, which makes the conversation confortable for you and the interlocutor.If you think the improving facial-expression seems diffcult, I advise you to make troubled face by lowering the outer end of eyebrows.
