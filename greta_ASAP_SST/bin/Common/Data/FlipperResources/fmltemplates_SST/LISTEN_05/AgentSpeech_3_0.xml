                 Oh! you know that. 
				 
            <tm id="tm1"/>
				 Currently, I live in Sakai, but  I used to live in Kishiwada city, the Danjiri city. 
				 
            <tm id="tm2"/>
				 I myself go back to my hometown every year to see the festival at christmas. 
				 
            <tm id="tm3"/>
				 Since I grow up with Danjiri, the festival always brings back good memories of the time I spent with my family. 
				 
            <tm id="tm4"/>
				 Do you have any memories of any kind of festivals?
				 
            <tm id="tm5"/>
				 If you have, how is it like?
				 
            <tm id="tm6"/>
