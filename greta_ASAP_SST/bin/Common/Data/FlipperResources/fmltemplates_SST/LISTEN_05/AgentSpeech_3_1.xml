                 Oh, I see. Danjiri is a festival where people pulls a rope, and runs around the city. 
				 
            <tm id="tm1"/>
				 It has tires attached to it, and it weigths several tons. 
				 
            <tm id="tm2"/>
				 I usually go there with my family. 
				 
            <tm id="tm3"/>
				 All those memories are precious for me. 
				 
            <tm id="tm4"/>
				 Do you have any memories of such a festival?
				 
            <tm id="tm5"/>
				 If you have, how is it like?
